# What is this?

A very small script that _should_ enable the Broadcom Wi-Fi chipset on Linux, this is specifically for Debian-based distributions. I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu 16.04 and is known to work on Debian 8.0, YMMV.

This is 100% copied from this __Stack Overflow__ question: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/260538/i-cant-connect-to-wi-fi-no-wlan0-device-on-iwconfig, specifically [__Dinir's__](http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/155206/dinir) answer.
